# maximization-and-minimization-of-a-function

Most of the economics models which tries to describe the individual choice of a consumer, of a firm or the policy maker like a Central Banker or Goverment, are based on the optimization of a function whose meaning is the wealth. 
The utility which gives one purchase is affected by the initial endownment, which on a mathematic point of view means 'a variable (our utility) as function of another variable(the quantity)'.
This approach is called 'Marginalistic' in the Economics literature.
